## 1/20/2026 10 PM - The birth of my idea!  

_Time spent: 1.2h_  

I've been **thinking** for a long time about what I could create with **ESP32**. 
I came up with a project with a **motor** that can be controlled via the web and I **started** working on it! First I took out all the **components** that were needed for the project and started thinking again about how I would connect it...![20260120_182717](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODY5NTMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--f2457a21e8a58e021569101137fe80fe14cff82d/20260120_182717.jpg)
  

## 1/20/2026 11:03 PM - Soldering button   

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

Before I even started doing **anything**, I had to solder my new touch button!
I took a **soldering iron** and started... at first it kept falling out, but then I managed it, there was only one **small mistake** - I heated the soldering iron too much and the plastic melted a little and the **pin** moved down a lot, but **luckily** I noticed it soon and put it back.

## 1/20/2026 11:17 PM - Cable preparation  

_Time spent: 1.1h_  

When I had finished **soldering**, I moved straight to **connecting** the cable to the components. I thought it would be easy, but it wasn't... 
At first I had to look for **cables** that I could use at all, because they were either the **wrong format** or too short. When I had it, another **problem** appeared - the cable for the **neopixel ring** was too short, so I had to take more jumpers and connect it to it, and to keep it from **falling**, I took **electrical tape** and wrapped it...

## 1/20/2026 11:30 PM - Connecting components to a breadboard   

_Time spent: 0.8h_  

I really liked these little breadboards because they **fit** easily into even the smallest **3D case** and most importantly they are **super cheap**! But when I had the cable preparation done, I started connecting the cables to the breadboard and to the **ESP32**. I failed a few times, but I managed it so I'm **one step further**...![20260120_201938](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODY5NjEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--4d103e720121819d64d3861fa6f1c2716355e4c7/20260120_201938.jpg)
  

## 1/20/2026 11:40 PM - Measurement of all components!  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

Before I even started **modeling**, I had to measure all the important parts. I started measuring mainly the **motor** so I could make a **housing** for it and **also** so it wouldn't move all the time. 
Once I had that, I continued with the **OLED**, the **buttons**, but I didn't forget the **USB-C connector** that will power everything!

## 1/21/2026 9:51 AM - Beginning of modeling  

_Time spent: 1.4h_  

After measuring all the parts, I moved to **TinkerCad**, where I started thinking about how to make a big case to fit everything in... I tried different sizes, but they were too **small**, so I chose **120x120mmm** and that **should** **be** enough.
Then I thought about how I could take my project **further**, so I made a **groove** for the turntable and started making holes in the **lower** **case**.
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODcyMzYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--47eac75a835ddf05e17d53960e8edb2185d313db/image.png)
  

## 1/21/2026 9:59 AM - Making better holes  

_Time spent: 0.9h_  

From my previous projects I have **learned** that it is always better to **spend** **a little more time** on making **holes** than to get _angry_ and do it again.
So I measured the **OLED** and touch button again, which were **important**, and started making better holes for them and I think I did it and **hopefully** it will fit in them!

## Motor bracket
After the **holes** for the components, I also worked on the **motor** **mount**, measuring exactly where the **cables** are, how tall it is, etc., and then I made the **aforementioned** mount for it.
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-01-20 174933](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODcyNDEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--3f53857fc0ee8cd350472ccf49ea40180af7cf2a/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-01-20%20174933.png)
  

## 1/21/2026 10:24 AM - Case improvements  

_Time spent: 1.7h_  

After everything I started **thinking** about where to place the neopixel ring and I thought about making a raised **area** for it and having it in the air above the **rotating** **platform**.
I prepared things for this in the program and started modeling. I had it about **2cm** thick before and then I made the **walls** **smaller** so that I didn't have to use so much **plastic** and that's just enough!
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-01-20 181158](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODcyNDMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--6fcf3fb4ecfe05387fbbeb5210f07fa84658f84d/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-01-20%20181158.png)
## Rotating plate 🛸
I also spent some time on the turntable, which **I had** to do very well otherwise the project would **fall** **apart**.
I measured the **motor** and started modeling the hole for the **rotating pin**, which just slides in and **glues** on!
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODcyNDUsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--3f2fba11fd88918c78b71a05e72019e6381bbc59/image.png)
  

## 1/21/2026 10:46 AM - Lower 3D case finished  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

After a few hours, the lower case is **finished** and now we can move on to the **upper part**, which will hold the neopixel ring.
I came up with a **mobile system** where you can adjust where you want to put the **ring** and then just secure it with a **safety pin** that sticks to the ring!
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-01-21 085103](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODcyNDksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--59b115db228a913f31e6c835df24b7282c4bd7a5/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-01-21%20085103.png)
## Making a stopper and a safety catch for the ring
I was thinking about how I would make a **stopper**, but mainly a **safety catch**....
At first I thought I could just make a small **strip**, but I ran out of that and so I made a **small** **shape** that will stick to the **ring** and prevent it from **falling** down.
I also made a **stopper** that will stick to the hand after I put on the **neopixel ring**.
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODcyNTEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--a828b5fcb7584b82b6f43746b2a31d31534e9bbb/image.png)
  

## 1/21/2026 11:45 AM - Printing time!!  

_Time spent: 0.9h_  

I had to print all the **parts**, so I got everything ready in **BambuLab** **studio** and started editing all the **files**... Once I had it, I had it **printed** and it came out great!
![1000024078](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODcyNzgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--92b8d744d9e6dc1744bf5dc0427e8acc9d82bc89/1000024078.jpg)

I just had to do a little **research** on _ironing_ (the thing that smooths out the surfaces of 3D models) and it took me a **while**, but when I printed it, it looked **really** **good**. 
Here are the settings:
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-01-21 105005](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODcyNzYsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--435f1cd0151b88822478a7c242a819915438a85a/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-01-21%20105005.png)
  

## 1/21/2026 11:59 AM - Cosmetic treatment for 3D case  

_Time spent: 0.8h_  

When I had everything **printed**, I moved on to removing the **supports** and smoothing out the **bumps** on the **case**.
At first I removed the supports on the **bottom** and it went well and **I was** **happy** with that, but sometimes I had to take a **knife** and cut off the bottom part of the support a little because it was "_glued_" to the print.
Then I also used a knife to remove all the **bumps** on the parts and cut off the **sharp** **edges**. But I also had to take a **lighter** and burn the "_cobwebs_" that were on some parts.
![20260120_205810](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODcyODEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--396868886de3e4cbb2ad347b8e907a67c0e65d9d/20260120_205810.jpg)
  

## 1/21/2026 12 PM - Preparing the case for gluing  

_Time spent: 0.9h_  

Before I start **gluing** everything together, I have to **sand** **all the surfaces** that will be joined with **sandpaper**. This method has worked for me in the past, so I use it all the **time** now!
First I took all the edges with **K240** sandpaper and later I took the larger joints with **K80**, which is even coarser.
I also cleaned everything with **isopropyl** **alcohol**, which removed the **grease** and made the glue stick as well as **possible**.
![20260121_121501](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODcyODMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--7a6b6f1a5a999c2a4784e6f8ff3636a340caf2e6/20260121_121501.jpg)
  

## 1/21/2026 6:35 PM - Touch sensor problem  

_Time spent: 0.5h_  

When i was checking if the power **LEDs** are on everywhere, I noticed that the LED on the touch sensor is **always** on (_even when I'm not touching it_) - and it **shouldn't** **be**.
So I thought it must be a broken sensor and I did some **research** and found out that the touch sensor always **calibrates** itself on the surface it's on.
I tried it and it really worked, I was **surprised**.
![20260120_210816](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc1NTMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--8aa6c1a245f6c5a4d035c7bd9f9506aad77b79de/20260120_210816.jpg)
  

## 1/21/2026 6:36 PM - Putting things in the case  

_Time spent: 1.8h_  

After **modifying** the case (and solving my big problem) I put all the things in the case, but I didn't **think** it would be that hard... At first I had to think about how to put the **breadboards** in there and how to arrange the cables, but I managed it only after **several** **attempts**, because my cables kept falling out and **running** **off** the table :(
When I managed to do that, I had to deal with one more thing, getting the **cable** for the ring up, but I managed that **too** (_it took me a while, but it was good_).
![20260121_150007](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc1NDcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--a722c7820d5d2b2a4afa37bf58c852087cc726d1/20260121_150007.jpg)
  

## 1/21/2026 6:45 PM - Gluing the case!!!  

_Time spent: 0.7h_  

I took my **glue** and started gluing the main parts. As always, I had to be **glued**, but I got over it and continued **gluing**...
I also glued all the parts to the case and it went pretty **quickly**! I also put the ring on so I could glue the **moving** **part**.
![20260121_150516](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc1NTcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--6ab3c40c2da11b355f6a9f665d1bf642a818004e/20260121_150516.jpg)
  

## 1/21/2026 7:37 PM - Holder for rotating platform  

_Time spent: 0.4h_  

Before I even started **coding**, I had to make a little **holder** for the motor that would stick to the **spinning platform**.
So I went back to TinkerCad and using the previous hole model I made it **pretty** **quickly** and printed it out in about _15 minutes_! Then I just **put** **it** on the motor and glued it together, but here's the pain.... The **glue** didn't hold well and when I spun it, it either fell off or **spun** **weirdly**, but I **fixed** it and we can continue!
![20260121_151427](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc1ODMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--30c724f0094d039ec12b4fbc9f0e2697e1299f4b/20260121_151427.jpg)
  

## 1/21/2026 7:58 PM - The 3D case is finished after a long time   

_Time spent: 0.9h_  

I can announce that I managed to finish the **3D** **case** and put everything together.
I had a lot of **problems** getting it done at all, but on the other hand I'm happy with how it **turned** **out**. **Everything** fits together beautifully, I also **modeled** the parts well and now we can move on to **coding**!!!
![1000024156](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc1OTAsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--4edbdda2002cd6882c078b264c888d77483a7f29/1000024156.jpg)
  

## 1/21/2026 9:17 PM - Component testing  

_Time spent: 1.1h_  

First I thought about how I would make the **logic** of the system itself, I came up with the **idea** that the **buttons** could change various functions or even turn the **motor**! 
But before that I had to test **everything** to see if it worked, so that I wouldn't have to **find** **out** at the end that it didn't work! So I started with all the **things** and it turned out that everything **worked** fine, which **I'm happy about** :)
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc3MTcsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--1f2f29598af06f790ef6361a7e6aaca16dd60454/image.png)
  

## 1/21/2026 9:22 PM - ESP32 code  

_Time spent: 1.8h_  

Immediately after **testing**, I threw myself into writing the **code** itself, which will be for the **ESP32**. I was thinking about how I would make the **buttons**, and I decided that the touch sensor would mainly be used to **control** the lights and the limit switch to control the **motor**.
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc3NjEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--39bec0073ac8439c4650b9f3bb59939e74521ad1/image.png)
## Website:
I was **happy** with the code for now, so I moved on to **implementing** the code for the **website**. I had to think about what it would **look** **like**, etc.:
- will it be white/black
- will it have normal buttons or smart black
- what will the motor control be like

And things like that took me a long time, but I started **coding** and here is the **first result** so far, which only **indicates** how it will **look**.
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-01-20 185408](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc3MDUsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--f9fd23bccd7cc9487ca12a2fbca9de0d979959ed/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-01-20%20185408.png)
  

## 1/21/2026 9:36 PM - Code editing!!  

_Time spent: 0.7h_  

I was still **finishing** things on the code and adding **functions** like when I hold down a button something **happens**, but in this part I mainly focused on the ring mods and its **modification**.
At first I didn't know what mods **I would make**, but I decided on **colorful** ones and also different ones with effects, here is an **example**:
![20260121_175356](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc3NzEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--a6429f615a83e3682c9f3a7bb1c8b023b79d0ebd/20260121_175356.jpg)
  

## 1/21/2026 9:38 PM - Implementing new things into the web  

_Time spent: 1.5h_  

After the **ESP32** main code was finished I was able to continue on the **website**, which is not finished at all and I was not **satisfied** yet, so I sat down again and started writing **new code**, but I **left** the theme and various things.
First I experimented with making a mod like every **button** and so far it looks pretty **good**:
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-01-20 192623](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc3NzQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--9b294146703a0c6d58350e1563abb93be43ad568/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-01-20%20192623.png)
  

## 1/21/2026 9:53 PM - Website and code completion  

_Time spent: 1.6h_  

I did some **research** and thought, if I could control the motor, I thought of a "**joystick**" like the one used to control a **printer**:
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-01-20 182356](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODc3OTAsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--c7454bca06e16fab441739236e4390f6c7d57023/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-01-20%20182356.png)

So I added it and continued with the last **edits** to the website and catching **errors**. I didn't know how to make an **OLED**, but I decided to go for an easier option and **put** there:
- IP address where the website is running
- Motor speed
- Whether the motor is running

## 1/24/2026 9 PM - Making BOM  

_Time spent: 0.6h_  

As always I have to create a **BOM**, so I started looking for all the parts on the **internet** and after about **half** **an hour** I had everything ready and ready. Then I put **everything** in spreadsheets and just edited... I **always** tried to find the cheapest things and to keep the **shipping** as low as possible!
![Snímek obrazovky 2026-01-21 180353](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTAyNTgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--4cd409ab4fb46166a440201618a9acac4838a644/Sn%C3%ADmek%20obrazovky%202026-01-21%20180353.png)
  

## 1/24/2026 10:05 PM - Scheme in Kicad  

_Time spent: 1.2h_  

Right after making the **BOM**, I moved straight to **KiCad**, where I started working on the wiring. It took a while before I figured it **out**... I was gradually adding all the things and creating the **wiring**. Before I **noticed it**, I initially had **5 pins** on the **OLED**, but then I fixed it to **4** :)
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTAyNjgsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--262ac56adbd2499eb74f56d93539c5aaa9597ab6/image.png)

  

## 1/24/2026 10:44 PM - Finishing the scheme!  

_Time spent: 1.3h_  

After a long time I had a finished **schematic**. It took me about +- **2.5** hours in total.
I added the **wiring** of everything there and then I connected everything to the **ESP32**. It took me a **while** to put everything together, but I think it's **good** now!
![image](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTAyOTQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--a5f09185a44380b633d99bc31173a792134c591b/image.png)
  

## 1/25/2026 12 PM - Exporting files  

_Time spent: 1.0h_  

Once I had everything ready, I moved on to creating a **GitHub** **repo** because I couldn't use it... I had to create all the **folders** and upload the files that were needed.
It also took me quite a while to convert the **.STL** files to **.STEP**, but we did it! Next, we added a **bill of materials** to the **README.md**, where I included everything. Later, I also uploaded and exported all the **files**.

_Time spent: 1.7h_  

**SRP** is a smart system controlled by **ESP32**. It can control a platform that is illuminated by a neopixel ring, all using buttons and the **web**!

## Why did I do this?

I wanted to create a project where I could put a thing on a platform and plug it in, then it would spin. So I thought about it and created this!

## Features

- Web interface
- It has a buzzer for notification
- Platform rotation with speed adjustment
- Neopixel ring for lighting

## Scripts

The script has approximately 230 lines, at the top you can add WiFi and password, then the system will be connected to the internet! Just upload it to the ESP32 and everything should work.

## How it works?

- If you turn on the system and if everything is written correctly, the ESP32 will connect to the internet and you can control everything via the web!
- On the OLED display you can see the speed of the motor and whether it is spinning. 
- You can also see the IP address to which the system is connected.
- You can control various things via the buttons and you can also map them to something else in the code yourself!

### Libraries:

```
WiFi.h
ESPAsyncWebServer.h
AccelStepper.h
Adafruit_SSD1306.h
Adafruit_NeoPixel.h
```
